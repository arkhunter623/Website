#Hello!

I am currently seeking a talented illustrator to help visualize the world I’m building. I’m looking for an artist to commission for both custom website artwork and the official cover of my upcoming book. If you have experience with [insert genre, e.g., sci-fi/fantasy] landscapes and character design, I’d love to see your portfolio. I’m looking for someone who can capture [mention a specific vibe, e.g., the gritty, neon-soaked atmosphere] of the story. If you're interested or know someone who fits the bill, please [link to contact page/email address]!
