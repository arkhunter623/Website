# Hello World!

Welcome to the new **arkhunter623.us**!

I decided to migrate away from WordPress to conserve server resources and have more control over my website's design. This entire site is now built with:

*   **HTML5 & CSS3** (No bulky frameworks)
*   **Node.js** (For building the static files)
*   **Markdown** (For writing these blog posts)

## Why the switch?

WordPress is great, but it requires a database (MySQL) and PHP processing for every single page load. By switching to a static site, I generate the HTML *once* on my computer, and the server just serves simple files. This is much faster and uses a fraction of the power!

Expect more updates soon!
